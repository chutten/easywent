grt-gtfs DEVELOPER DIARY:

1) Tried looking directly into gtfs-realtime js. Nothing obvious beyond a (google?) npm lib which... might have worked? Not too interested. 
2) Backed up a level of abstraction and found protobuf.js (https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js). Gonna use that
3) Reading.
Install nodejs-legacy
Install npm
(( good god, how I hate "server-side" JS and its dependency hell ))
npm install inside protobuf.js (master)
_now_ pbjs works

Convert latest gtfs-realtime.proto to json. Yay.

Time to write index.html... wait

Need to copy over the deps. Fine. clone bytebuffer, copy it.min and protobuf-light.min over

CORS fail on GRT's behalf. Sent them an email via automated form, we'll see what comes of it.

For now, pulled down local copies of latest data to do some finagling.
Though, really, maybe I should just pretend to be realtimemap.grt.ca, because IIRC it didn't have so much crap to wade through.

Anyhoo, got the parser working. Man is it wordy.
Wow, I don't have any idea of how to use this data. I need to read the GTFS and GTFS-realtime specs more closely.
